An implementation of cracks recognition. 


COMMENTS:
- 4 Convolutional layers and 4 Linear layers seems to provide the best overall results (training time/epoch- and accuracy- wise)
- (initial) Learning rate seems to be best set at 10^-3 overall. (In some setups initial learning rate=10 was better)
- Sampling (after shuffle) seems to have similar results to the overall dataset
- Time/epoch, depending on architecture and using local physical device CPU, varies from 20-80 sec
- ~80% accuracy with current configuration 
- Coming soon is an implementation using Cuda, as soon as I get my new graphics card
